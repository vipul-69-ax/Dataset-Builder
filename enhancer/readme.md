# Image Enhancer

The files generated by **Dataset Builder** are low in quality and needs enhancement. Integrating enhancer in the application was causing the app to use large amounts of memory 
resources. So we have decided to use an alternative solution. We have created a python script which is specifically programmed to enhance to your images. 

### How to run the file?

Open up your terminal in the location where your index.py is stored and write the following code. But before running the file make sure you have provided path to the folder where
your images are stored (which need to be enhanced). Here is an example:

```python
LOCATION = "V:/My Images"
```
### Command to run in terminal
```terminal
python index.py
```

That's all you need to do. If you have multiple folders you can run a loop to enhance images in multiple folders.
